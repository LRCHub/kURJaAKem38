[00:09.47] Oh, nah-nah-nah, ayy
[00:11.44] Oh, nah-nah-nah, ayy
[00:13.97] Nah-nah-nah, ayy
[00:16.07] Oh, nah-ah
[00:21.07] 
[00:17.68] I know I'm supposed to, but I can't shake that feeling I'm wrong
[00:21.93] Said I won't lie to you, but I'm pretty good at playing along
[00:26.23] Hope for the best, expect the worst, plan on you doing me wrong
[00:30.68] Thinking about leaving, I'm nervous
[00:48.18] 
[00:33.76] 'Cause I know it's a long way from perfect
[00:36.93] And I don't even know if I'm on that path, I
[00:39.17] Think you did that on purpose
[00:41.02] Feel strange on the phone, won't call you back, I
[00:43.76] Can't let my guard down 'cause I can't trust that you got my back
[00:48.00] The countdown not working, I can feel that reemerging
[01:14.50] 
[00:52.17] Three, two, one, yeah, you got me, baby
[00:54.63] You want me to say it's all my fault
[00:56.16] But it's not my fault, I just think you're crazy
[00:58.76] I know it's different, you could tell me it's the same thing
[01:01.11] I know I'm tripping, you could come and be my main squeeze
[01:03.29] And I'll do everything you want, but, baby, say plеase
[01:05.33] And you been running around in circles tryna change mе
[01:07.62] But let's be honest, you know it don't ever phase me
[01:09.58] Texas, Paris, London, everywhere I got another one
[01:14.02] Don't know why I'm stressing, I think I just gotta slow it down
[01:18.43] You said that you want me, but I know how you be playing around
[01:22.64] You must think I'm stupid, but it's cool, girl, I'll see you around
[01:56.14] 
[01:27.23] I know I'm supposed to, but I can't shake that feeling I'm wrong
[01:31.69] Said I won't lie to you, but I'm pretty good at playing along
[01:36.09] Hope for the best, expect the worst, plan on you doing me wrong
[01:40.39] Thinking about leaving, I'm nervous
[01:57.89] 
[01:43.56] 'Cause I know it's a long way from perfect
[01:46.46] And I don't even know if I'm on that path, I
[01:48.83] Think you did that on purpose
[01:50.74] Feel strange on the phone, won't call you back, I
[01:53.34] Can't let my guard down 'cause I can't trust that you got my back
[01:57.62] The countdown not working, I can feel that reemerging now
[02:26.12] 
[02:02.17] Long way from perfect, and I don't even know if I'm on that path, I
[02:06.28] Think you did that on purpose
[02:08.11] Feel strange on the phone, won't call you back, I
[02:10.84] Can't let my guard down 'cause I can't trust that you got my back
[02:15.00] The countdown not working, I can feel that reemerging
